```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow public read/write access to hangman_scores collection
    match /hangman_scores/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow public read/write access to leaderboard collection (alternative)
    match /leaderboard/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"**

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Permission denied" errors:
- Check that security rules are published correctly
- Verify the collection name matches exactly: `hangman_scores`

### If you see "Network error" or "Failed to fetch":
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase project is active
- Try refreshing the page

### If scores don't appear:
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Verify the score was actually added to Firestore
- Check if the query is ordering by the correct field
